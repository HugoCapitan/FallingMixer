# Falling Mixer

Falling Mixer will be a small app containing all the funcitonality necessary to make music using code. Specically Java Code.

The app will load Samples from a specific folder and alow the user to use different methods and classes to modify and combine those sounds into a full musical piece.

The app will be able to manage multiple channels, each channel being a representation of a part of the musical piece, a channel might represent a single instrument or perhaps an abstraction of a part of the piece.

Each channel will hold a timeline of sounds, sounds in channels can't be overlaped, but channels can.

It will be possible to decorate each sound with special decorators for effects, duration, volume or modification.
